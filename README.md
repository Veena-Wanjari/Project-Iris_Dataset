__Iris Dataset from Kaggle__

The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower 'Iris-setosa', 'Iris-versicolor' and 'Iris-virginica'. 
One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

__The columns in this dataset are:__

1) Sepal Length (Cm)
2) Sepal Width (Cm)
3) Petal Length(Cm)
4) Petal Width(Cm) 
5) Species

__This folder consists of:__

1) Iris Classification : Logistic regression classifier is used
2) Iris Kaggle : 
- Performed Univaraite analysis(PDF, CDF, Boxplot, Voilin plots) to understand which features are useful towards classification.
- Perform Bi-variate analysis (scatter plots, pair-plots) to see if combinations of features are useful in classfication.
3) iris.csv file
